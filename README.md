# Financial-Aid-Guide-App
The Financial Aid Guide app is an application written in Java that was created as a senior project for my bachelor's degree program. The app can be used to create a custom PDF document containing important information about college costs and financial aid that can help first-time students to save money on their college expenses.

This application was written in Java and utilizes the iText external Java library (version 7.1.9) for the purposes of creating a PDF document. You can find more information and documentation for this library on itextpdf.com.

# Downloading the Application
When downloading the application file, it is strongly recommended that users save the application to the desktop to avoid potential issues with creating and saving the PDF document.

# MacOS Users
When opening the application for the first time, MacOS users will need to hold the 'control' key, click on the application file, then click 'Open'. This is only needed the first time you open the application file.
